Dear Staff, The Watson Studio asked for a credit card to finish the peer graded assignement which I had lost it days ago when I was mugged.
Classification with Python
In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Let's first load required libraries:

About dataset
This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

Field	Description
Loan_status	Whether a loan is paid off on in collection
Principal	Basic principal loan amount at the
Terms	Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule
Effective_date	When the loan got originated and took effects
Due_date	Since it’s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date
Age	Age of applicant
Education	Education of applicant
Gender	The gender of applicant
Let's download the dataset

Data visualization and pre-processing
Let’s see how many of each class is in our data set

PAIDOFF       260
COLLECTION     86
Name: loan_status, dtype: int64
260 people have paid off the loan on time while 86 have gone into collection

Let's plot some columns to underestand data better:

Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

# All requested packages already installed.



Pre-processing: Feature selection/extraction
Let's look at the day of the week people get the loan

We see that people who get the loan at the end of the week don't pay it off, so let's use Feature binarization to set a threshold value less than day 4

Unnamed: 0	Unnamed: 0.1	loan_status	Principal	terms	effective_date	due_date	age	education	Gender	dayofweek	weekend
0	0	0	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-08	2016-10-07	45	High School or Below	male	3	0
1	2	2	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-08	2016-10-07	33	Bechalor	female	3	0
2	3	3	PAIDOFF	1000	15	2016-09-08	2016-09-22	27	college	male	3	0
3	4	4	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-09	2016-10-08	28	college	female	4	1
4	6	6	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-09	2016-10-08	29	college	male	4	1
Convert Categorical features to numerical values
Let's look at gender:

Gender  loan_status
female  PAIDOFF        0.865385
        COLLECTION     0.134615
male    PAIDOFF        0.731293
        COLLECTION     0.268707
Name: loan_status, dtype: float64
86 % of female pay there loans while only 73 % of males pay there loan

Let's convert male to 0 and female to 1:

Unnamed: 0	Unnamed: 0.1	loan_status	Principal	terms	effective_date	due_date	age	education	Gender	dayofweek	weekend
0	0	0	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-08	2016-10-07	45	High School or Below	0	3	0

4	6	6	PAIDOFF	1000	30	2016-09-09	2016-10-08	29	college	0	4	1

1	1000	30	33	1	0	1	0	0

What are our lables?

array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
Normalize Data
Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance (technically should be done after train test split)

StandardScaler()
Classification
Now, using the training set to build an accurate model. Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model You should use the following algorithm:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

During the 7x10 Repeated Stratified KFolds validation, we are getting a visible peak at 42 Neighbors for all the scoring metrics i.e. Jaccard, F1 and Accuracy Score.
And Also we are getting a lower range of scores which shows scores are not too much far away from each other, which tells that 42 neighbors yeild scores on a more
deterministic side than smaller values of 'k'.

----- Therefore 42 Neighbors is the optimal number of neighbors for KNN Classifier ------
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=42)
Decision Tree



We will move forward with max_depth = 1

DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1, random_state=42)
Support Vector Machine

SVC(C=0.1)
Logistic Regression

LogisticRegression(C=0.1)
